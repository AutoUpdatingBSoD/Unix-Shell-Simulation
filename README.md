- Must be run on a version of Unix (Including, but not limited to Unix Shell on RUCS,
Ubuntu Linux, MacOS X through Unix CMD Tools, and MinGW Windows.
- Windows C++ is not supported for this application.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Under Versions Listed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Type make in the Unix, Linux, or MacOS terminal to compile the program in those Operating Systems
- Use MinGWâ€™s 32-Bit Make to compile the file for Windows in the command line.
- Run ./RUSH example.bin to run the program, where ./RUSH is your executable and example.bin is any file you specify.

Commands to run in RUSHell:
- pwd : prints the working directory
- ls : calls PWD, but also lists all the files and directories in the current directory.
- createTextFile : Creates an up to 8 alphanumeric character filename with two character extension '.t', and creates its contents.
- mkdir dir : creates an up to 8 alphabetic character directory of name 'dir'
- cd dir : changes to specified directory name 'dir', or if .. is entered changes to the directory above the one you're in.
- cat filename.t : prints a file of name filename and of extension .t
- run progname.p: runs a program of program name 'progname' and of extension '.p'. Prints a statement for now.
- step progname.p: steps a program of program name 'progname' and of extension '.p'. Prints a statement for now.
